# changenotifyapp

An app using Provider::ChangeNotifierProvider to duplicate 
the Flutter starter app, without using a stateful widget.

The starter app uses a stateful widget and couples 
two widgets (the count text and the increment button). This
app eliminates the coupling by providing the Counter 
object as a middleman through use of the ChangeNotifierProvider.
